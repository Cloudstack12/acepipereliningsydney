                    <b>What is Pipe Relining Exactly? </b><br>

In the past, if you had an issue with a <b>blocked drain, blocked pipe, leaking pipe,</b> or issues with sewer systems. It could be an expensive and messy process finding a solution. <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    For that reason, if a <b>plumbing pipe issue</b> was to arise nowadays this situation can be rectified easily. Nowadays, modern technology has made it possible to find solutions quickly. Specifically, a company in Germany called Bawoliner developed technology that was a complete game-changer. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Short History of Fixing Blocked Pipes or Leaking Pipes</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    As mentioned, in the past, <b>fixing a broken pipe or blocked drain</b> could be messy. Basically, a plumber would have to dig a series of holes on a property. To find the piece of pipe causing the issue. Essentially, you would need to pay for hours of labour and be left with a very messy yard. <br>
                    <br>

Therefore, saving property owners huge amounts of money and headaches. That is to say, Brawoliner technology is available worldwide for use. <br>

                    <b>What do I do If I have a Blocked or Broken Pipe?</b> <br>
